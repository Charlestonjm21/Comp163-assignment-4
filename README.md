# 🎮 Survive the Semester: A Python Text-Based Game

## 📖 Overview
**Survive the Semester** is a text-based Python game where players step into the shoes of a college student balancing academics, social life, and stress.  
The goal is simple: **make it to the end of the semester without burning out or dropping your GPA too low.**  

Players make decisions about course loads, study priorities, and social balance. Each decision affects **GPA, study hours, stress level, and social points**, ultimately leading to multiple possible endings.

## 🧩 Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates **Python branching and decision-making** concepts through different sections of the game:

- **If/Elif/Else statements** → Used throughout the course load and subject choice decisions.
- **Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)** → Used in the subject focus decision to check GPA + social points.
- **Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)** → Used in the final assessment to validate data types and create unique conditions.
- **Nested If Statements** → In the final semester assessment, GPA checks include further stress-level checks.
- **Multiple Endings (3+)** → The game has different outcomes depending on GPA, stress, and decisions made.

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.
2. Save the game code into a file named `survive_the_semester.py`.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in the same directory.
4. Run the program:

## 🏁 Endings

The game has multiple possible endings depending on the player's final stats:

🏆 Dean’s List – Achieve excellent GPA while keeping stress manageable.

😓 High GPA, High Stress – Great grades, but you’re close to burning out.

😊 Balanced Success – A good balance between academics and social life.

⚠️ Survived but Stressed – You finish, but stress nearly breaks you.

📉 Barely Made It – GPA is too low, or stress takes too big of a toll.

##📊 Example Stats at the End

At the conclusion of the game, the following statistics are displayed:

Student Name

Final GPA

Total Study Hours

Final Stress Level

Social Points

## 🤝 AI Assistance Used
I used ChatGPT to help me understand why some part of my code wasn't working and to help me understand complex ideas, but the code was created by myself.
